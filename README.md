# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose).  
This repository is like that one, but with non-Java languages trimmed and Gradle added.

## Refactoring Instructions:
You will find the requirements for the program saved at the root directory under ["GildedRoseRequirements.txt"](./GildedRoseRequirements.txt).

You've been provided with (very refactorable) production code that may or may not satisfy these requirements.  What's different from last week is that this time, 
you have not been provided tests.

Spend the first 15 minutes without changing any of the production code - just design and implement tests that will help you know when it is working.  
I'll announce when test-only time has ended.
We'll also spend 15 minutes at the end reviewing our decisions.
That leaves you 30 minutes in the middle during which you can either write more tests, refactor production, or a mix of both.

### Building & Testing

`gradlew build` and `gradlew test` as requested
